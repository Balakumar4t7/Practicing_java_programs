Java Daily Practice

This repository contains my daily Java practice programs focused on strengthening core programming concepts and problem-solving skills for placements.

Purpose

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in Java by practicing consistently and organizing solutions in a structured manner. All programs are written and tested using IntelliJ IDEA.

Topics Covered

Basic syntax and input/output

Conditional statements

Loops and pattern problems

Arrays and strings

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Exception handling

Collections framework

File handling and miscellaneous logic problems

Project Structure

Programs are organized into packages inside the src folder based on topics or practice days.

Example structure:

├── day01_basics
├── day02_conditionals
├── day03_loops
├── day04_arrays
├── day05_strings
├── day06_oop
└── day07_collections

Each package contains individual Java programs related to that topic.
